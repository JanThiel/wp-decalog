__Capture and log events, metrics and traces on your site. Make WordPress observable - finally!__

See [WordPress directory page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/decalog/) or [official website](https://perfops.one/decalog).

De-facto standard stack for WordPress observability, __DecaLog__ provides reliable and powerful logging, monitoring and tracing features for WordPress core, PHP, database, plugins and themes.

__DecaLog__ captures events generated by WordPress core, PHP, database, plugins and themes, collates metrics and KPIs and follows traces of the full WordPress execution. It has the ability to enrich these events, metrics and traces with many details regarding their triggering, before storing them in WordPress database or passing them to external services.

If you don't want to use external services, __DecaLog__ provides the tools to leverage all the benefits of observability right in the WordPress admin dashboard. It supports multisite logs delegation and contains many features to help to protect personal information (user pseudonymization, IP obfuscation, etc.).

For a full list of supported - internal or third-party - services please, jump to the official [supported services list](https://perfops.one/decalog#services).

__DecaLog__ can be used in dev/debug phases or on production sites: it has nearly no resource impact on the server. It provides an extensive set of WP-CLI commands to help operations too.
