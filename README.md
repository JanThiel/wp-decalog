__DecaLog__ is a free WordPress plugin to capture and log events on your site. It allows to view these events in your WordPress dashboard and send them to logging or alerting services.

See [WordPress directory page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/decalog/). 

__DecaLog__ is a tool that aims to:
* capture events generated by the core of WordPress and themes / plugins;
* enrich these events with many details regarding their triggering;
* record these events in the WordPress database and/or send them to external services for logging, monitoring and alerting;
* view (and filter) events recorded in the WordPress database.

It supports multisite logs delegation and contains many features to help to protect personal information (user pseudonymization, IP obfuscation, etc.).

It can be used in dev/debug phases or on production sites: it has nearly no resource impact on the server.

At this time, __DecaLog__ can send events:
* by mail (alerting);
* in the browser console (for debugging purpose);
* to its internal logging storage and viewer;
* to external logger, like Syslog or Fluentd;
* to external logging services, like Logentries / insightOps or Loggly;
* to external alerting services, like Pushover or Slack;
* to local or network storage (with file rotation);
* to WP-CLI console.

In addition to the events generated by your site (PHP, database, WordPress core), **DecaLog** logs all events from:

* [Apache Status & Info](https://wordpress.org/plugins/htaccess-server-info-server-status/)
* [APCu Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/apcu-manager/)
