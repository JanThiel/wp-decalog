Capture and log events on your site. View them in your dashboard and send them to logging services.

== Description ==

**Capture and log events on your site. View them in your dashboard and send them to logging services.**

**DecaLog** is a tool that aims to:

* capture events generated by the core of WordPress and themes / plugins;
* enrich these events with many details regarding their triggering;
* record these events in the WordPress database and/or send them to external services for logging, monitoring and alerting;
* view (and filter) events recorded in the WordPress database.

It supports multisite logs delegation (see FAQ) and contains many features to help to protect personal information (user pseudonymization, IP obfuscation, etc.).

It can be used in dev/debug phases or on production sites.

At this time, **DecaLog** can send events:

* by mail (alerting);
* in the browser console (for debugging purpose);
* to its internal logging storage and viewer;
* to external logger, like Syslog or Fluentd;
* to external logging services, like Logentries / insightOps or Loggly;
* to ELK stacks like Sematext or Elastic Cloud;
* to external alerting services, like Pushover or Slack;
* to local or network storage (with file rotation);

**DecaLog** is a free and open source plugin for WordPress. It integrates many other free and open source works (as-is or modified). Please, see 'about' tab in the plugin settings to see the details.
