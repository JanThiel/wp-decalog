# Developing for DecaLog

Before starting to explain how to use DecaLog from a developer point of view, I would like to thank you to take the time to invest your knowledge and skills in making DecaLog better and more useful. I'll only have one word: you rock! (OK, that's two words)

## What is DecaLog?
DecaLog is WordPress plugin which aims to:
- capture events generated by the core of WordPress and themes / plugins;
- enrich these events with many details regarding their triggering;
- record these events in the WordPress database and/or send them to external services for logging, monitoring and alerting;
- view (and filter) events recorded in the WordPress database.

## Definitions
When using (and developing for) DecaLog, you will have to deal with the following notions:
- __Event__ - An event is some bits of information regarding something which hapened while executing WordPress. See [Anatomy of an event](#anatomy-of-an-event) to know what it's made of.
- __Listener__ - A listener is, as its name suggests, something that listens to what's going on in a specific _perimeter_ (mainly a specific WordPress component or subsystem), make it an __event__ and pass this __event__ to the running __loggers__.
- __Logger__ - A logger is a _recorder_ of events. It can filter them (accept or refuse to record the event based on settings) then store them (in a database, a file, etc.) or send them (via API calls, sockets, mails, etc.).
